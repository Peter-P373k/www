Most people start their quest by using a search engine.

are trying to find you, first of all by entering keywords
or more correctly phrases into a search engine. Today 
people tend to enter phrases containing between 2 and 5 
words.

<FONT Arial,B,14>Don't Submit to the Search Engines.</FONT>
</URL>
Having done the keyword research and designed your pages
to rank highly, all you need to do now is get those 
pages into the search engine database and the visitors 
come flooding in. 

This bit used to be very easy, you would just go to each
engine, find the submit button and enter the information. 
With a bit of luck your pages would be in the database 
within a few weeks. If they weren't you would simply 
re-submit again.

Today the search engine world is a little more complex 
and, with certain engines, using the Submit function can
harm your final ranking within the database.

Popularity. For a long time I thought this to be true 
- however I was wrong. 

The real truth behind link popularity is far more 
complex, but once understood, can be more powerful 
than page optimization.
